1. Change security group settings to not to allow ssh connections from the internet
2. Disable the passwords for ssh login 
3. Set stronger password complexity/ paraphrase for ssh users
4. Lock out accounts after a defined number of incorrect password attempts
5. Use AWS Systems Manager to SSH into an EC2 instance for application server 
6. Restrict the IPs that are allowed to access by providing a CIDR block or specific IP address


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

1. Create S3 Bucket Policies: Use policies to restrict and control access using ACLs
2. Encrypt the data on S3 using server side encryption 
3. Potentially, set up MFA-protected API access that requires AWS MFA device before calling S3 API operations
