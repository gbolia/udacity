
# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Make use of AWS Systems Manager's Session Manager service to access the application server.
Remove ssh access from the instance. 

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Setting a bucket poliy that restricts access to specific VPC limits access just to the VPC private endpoint(s).
Though it will limit the traffic from internet there is still a likelihood of unauthorized access from within VPC.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, only the new objects are encrypted. Old objects stay unencrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All the changes done by console/ cli will be reset
