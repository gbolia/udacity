Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
S3.5 S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer
S3.13 S3 buckets should have lifecycle policies configured
S3.4 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
Network ACLs should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 or port 3389
Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Be specific in configuring IP range for security groups on port 22
Enable VPC flow logging
Encrypt s3 buckets
Encrypt EC2 volumes
Remove unrestricted access to port 3389
Use https
