Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.


# Poor Practice 1. Least Privilege Violation (s3 full access)
InstanceRole(IAM role) has full access to any s3 bucket instance.  The common security practice of granting least privilege is not practiced.
Roles should be specific to the list of resources and actions. 

# Poor Practice 2. Least Privilege Violation (access to all instances) 
Acesss to S3 is not specified by separate roles with appropriate policies set for specific actions on specific buckets.
The two instances (RecipeWebServiceInstance and AttackInstance) have the same IAM role.

# Poor practice 3. Infrastructure not secured
Web service is hosted by an HTTP load balancer listening on port 80. 
Also, the Cloudformation template for EC2 shows that WebAppSG has inbound traffic opened for port 5000,22 and 80 ports which is base Http communication. 
Ideally, as internet facing application port 443 should be set up for secured http comm.

#Poort Practice 4. Limited Ingress and Egress Controls
Security Groups (WebAppSG, AppLoadBalancerSG) applied to resources allow all incoming traffic. They are not
restricted to specific source networks or IP ranges leaving it open for unwanted connections/ attackers.
